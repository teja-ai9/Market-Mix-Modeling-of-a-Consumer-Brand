# Market-Mix-Modeling-of-a-Consumer-Brand
 The purpose of using MMM is to understand how much each marketing input contributes to sales, and how much to spend on each marketing input. In this project, we perform MMM on a consumer brand and the analysis performed through Regression is further used for extracting key information/insights.
